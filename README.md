# divide-thirds
This is a very simple Gimp Script-Fu script to divide a canvas quickly into thirds

This should be placed in your scripts folder in your Gimp directory.
This may differ by OS so check with your installation.

For me on Linux it's ~/.config/GIMP/2.10/scripts/

This will add a new option to the Script-Fu menu in Gimp.
